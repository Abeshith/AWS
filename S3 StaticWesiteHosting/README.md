# AWS S3 Static Website Hosting

## What are S3 Buckets?

**Amazon S3 (Simple Storage Service)** buckets are containers that hold your files in the cloud. Think of them as folders on the internet where you can store websites, images, documents, and any other files. S3 buckets are:

- **Globally accessible** - Anyone can access your files (if you allow it)
- **Highly durable** - Your files are safely stored across multiple locations
- **Cost-effective** - Pay only for what you store and transfer
- **Scalable** - Store unlimited amounts of data

## Bucket Versioning

**Versioning** keeps multiple versions of the same file in your bucket. When you upload a new version of `index.html`, S3 keeps the old version too.

**Benefits:**
- **Backup protection** - Accidentally deleted files can be recovered
- **Change tracking** - See all versions of your files
- **Rollback capability** - Easily restore previous versions
